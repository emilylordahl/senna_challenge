## To Use
Unzip the packaged file attached to my email, which contains files needed to run this app. Move the files to a location on your computer you will remember.

In the command line, navigate to that location/root file of the app and run `npm install` from the command line. This should download the dependcencies needed to run this app.

Once this process has successfully completed, run `nodemon` (if you have it installed) or `node server.js` from the root directory to start the server.

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in Chrome to view the app.

Search for a known Twitter user and see the follower count!
